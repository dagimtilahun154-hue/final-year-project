# 1. Introduction
## 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification defines the functional and non-functional requirements for Ankelba, a Parent Communication and Child Activity Reporting Platform for Daycare Centers. It translates the updated senior project proposal into a more precise description of what the software must do, who is allowed to do it, what information is managed, how the major modules interact, and what constraints must be respected during design, implementation, testing, and evaluation.

The document is intended to serve as the requirements baseline for the project team and as a review document for the advisor. Requirements that are not fully decided in the proposal are marked as TBD or are explicitly identified for advisor confirmation rather than being silently assumed.

## 1.2 Product Scope
Ankelba is designed to organize communication and child-related reporting between daycare administrators, caregivers or teachers, and registered parents or guardians. The core platform manages users, child profiles, attendance, daily activity reports, health and incident reports, parent-daycare communication, report history, announcements, alerts, and administrative monitoring.

The updated scope also includes five added areas: a centralized database and record-management layer, an AI Parent Guide, biometric verification of authorized adult guardians during child pickup, a limited daycare e-commerce module, and a simple events calendar. These additions extend the original communication and reporting system but do not change Ankelba into a complete daycare enterprise-management system.

## 1.3 Intended Audience
- Project advisor and academic reviewers, who will review the completeness and correctness of the requirements.

- Project team members, who will use the SRS as the basis for analysis, design, implementation, and testing.

- Daycare administrators and caregivers, who may validate operational workflows and access rules.

- Parents or guardians participating in requirements validation or user-acceptance evaluation.

- Future maintainers or developers who need to understand the intended behavior and boundaries of the system.

## 1.6 Requirement Language and Conventions
The word 'shall' identifies a mandatory requirement for the planned system. 'Should' identifies a desirable requirement that may depend on available time, hardware, or external-service approval. Requirements marked TBD need advisor or stakeholder confirmation before the SRS is baselined for implementation.

# 2. Overall Description
## 2.1 Product Perspective
Ankelba is a purpose-built daycare information system rather than a general messaging application. It centralizes child-related information and provides role-based interfaces for parents or guardians, caregivers or teachers, and daycare administrators. The core reporting and communication functions remain the foundation of the system. AI guidance, biometric guardian verification, e-commerce, and events management are additional modules connected through the same centralized data layer.

*Note: Access for caregivers/teachers is limited to the children and functions permitted by the daycare. The exact assignment model will be confirmed during requirements review.*

## 2.5 Operating Environment
- Responsive web application accessible from modern desktop and mobile web browsers.

- Proposed application stack from the project proposal: React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, and PostgreSQL database.

- Internet or local network connectivity is required for features that depend on server access; cloud-based AI and digital payment require internet connectivity.

- Biometric verification requires a compatible adult biometric device or supported platform interface at the daycare. The exact device/modality is TBD.

- A secure hosting or local deployment environment will be selected during deployment preparation.

## 2.6 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Child-related information is sensitive and shall be accessible only to authorized users.

- The first version shall not collect biometric data from children.

- Biometric verification shall remain an additional pickup safety control, not the only available method for releasing a child to an authorized guardian.

- The AI Parent Guide shall remain within general informational guidance and shall not provide medical diagnosis, treatment, or professional psychological counseling.

- The e-commerce module shall be limited to products supplied by the daycare and shall not operate as a third-party marketplace or home-delivery service.

- Digital payment depends on approval and connectivity of the selected external payment gateway; Pay at Daycare remains available.

- The project shall remain achievable within the senior-project timeline and available student resources.

## 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
- A selected daycare center and representative users will provide sufficient feedback for requirements validation and pilot evaluation.

- Authorized staff will enter child and activity information accurately and on time.

- The daycare will define which adult guardians are authorized to collect each child.

- If a cloud AI provider is used, the provider will be available during AI-guidance use; failure of the AI service shall not prevent core daycare reporting functions.

- Live digital payments require a valid merchant/payment-gateway setup. Sandbox testing may be used if live approval is not available during development.

- Biometric hardware availability and supported integration method will be confirmed before biometric implementation is finalized.

## 2.8 Out of Scope
- Payroll and employee recruitment

- Complete accounting

- Daycare fee collection

- Transportation management

- Live CCTV streaming

- GPS tracking

- Automatic medical diagnosis

- Government or hospital system integration

- Home-delivery logistics

- Third-party marketplace selling

- Advanced warehouse management

- Biometric identification of children

# 11. Acceptance and Validation Criteria
The first-release system will be considered ready for final project evaluation when the mandatory requirements selected for the MVP have been implemented and verified, the critical access/privacy rules are satisfied, and the system can demonstrate the main end-to-end daycare workflows. Exact quantitative performance targets and any TBD items must be resolved or formally documented before final acceptance.

| **AC-07** | The central database maintains correct relationships for users, children, reports, events, biometric references, products, orders, and payments implemented in the MVP.      |
| **AC-08** | AI Parent Guide returns general guidance for supported everyday topics and handles out-of-scope medical/psychological requests within its defined limits.                    |
| **AC-09** | An authorized adult guardian can be biometrically verified during pickup, and the controlled manual fallback can be demonstrated when biometric verification is unavailable. |
| **AC-10** | A parent can browse daycare products, create an order, choose Pay at Daycare or the available digital-payment option, and view order status.                                 |
| **AC-11** | A digital-payment order is marked Paid only after verified gateway confirmation in the implemented integration or sandbox demonstration.                                     |
| **AC-12** | An administrator can create an event and a parent/guardian can view it in the simple calendar/event list.                                                                    |
| **AC-13** | A backup and restore procedure for the selected database environment is demonstrated.                                                                                        |
| **AC-14** | No unresolved critical defect is known that allows unauthorized child-data access, incorrect guardian authorization, or false digital-payment confirmation.                  |

# Appendix A. Advisor Review Checklist
This checklist is included to make the next advisor meeting productive. Items checked or corrected after the meeting can be used to create the next SRS revision.

- Confirm the final user roles and caregiver/group access rules.

- Confirm whether activity photographs are required in the first release.

- Confirm whether first-release notifications are in-app only or include another channel.

- Confirm the biometric device/modality to be demonstrated.

- Confirm the manual guardian-verification fallback procedure.

- Confirm the AI provider and what child context may be sent to it.

- Confirm the digital-payment gateway and whether the defense requires live money transfer or sandbox verification.

- Confirm the order-status names and stock-update rule.

- Confirm data-retention expectations for child, biometric, AI, and e-commerce records.

- Confirm measurable performance expectations for the selected daycare pilot.

- Confirm whether any SRS requirement should be deferred to a later release.

**End of Software Requirements Specification - Version 1.0**


## Implementation clarification — 3 October 2026

The user confirmed that the admin interface is web-based and that caregivers/daycare staff assigned to front-desk duty sign in with their own staff credentials to record attendance, verify authorized adult guardians, and complete pickups. “Guardian” remains the adult pickup designation; it does not grant staff authority. This clarifies sections 2.4–2.5, FR-UAM-01–03, FR-ATT-01–07 and FR-BIO-01–10.

- **FR-DESK-01:** An administrator can assign and revoke front-desk duty for a specified date/shift and record scope.
- **FR-DESK-02:** Assigned staff use the web workspace under their own authenticated identity; duty does not grant full admin access.
- **FR-DESK-03:** The server enforces active duty, permitted actions and child/group scope on every attendance and pickup operation. Teaching assignments and desk assignments are separate.
- **FR-DESK-04:** Verification, fallback and checkout retain the selected child/adult, staff actor, result and timestamps in audit-capable records. The existing verification-before-checkout requirement remains mandatory for the configured pickup workflow.
- **UI-DESK-01:** The admin and staff web interfaces share the approved parent app logo, typography, colors, cards and background treatment, with responsive desktop navigation and detailed operational views.

These are requirements, not a statement that the current backend implements shift assignments. Detailed scope, acceptance checks and open policy/device decisions are tracked in [DELIVERY_PLAN.md](DELIVERY_PLAN.md).
